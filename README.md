# XCode Discord Rich Presence

Show what you are editing on XCode. This obviously only works on MacOS.

## Usage

You can do this or run the installation command which compiles the js into a binary and adds it to your bin.

1) Clone the repo

2) Run `yarn` (or `npm i`)

3) Open XCode

4) Run `babel-node src/index.js`

## Installing

1) `yarn global add pkg` (or `npm i -g pkg`)

2) `yarn i` (or `npm run i`)

Thats all, the binary has been added to `/usr/local/bin` and you can run it in terminal with `XC-RPC`.

## Issues
